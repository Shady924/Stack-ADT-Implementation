    A Stack is a simple data structure used for storing data (similar to Linked Lists). In a stack, the
order in which the data arrives is important.A pile of plates in a cafeteria is a good example of a
stack. The plates are added to the stack as they are cleaned and they are placed on the top. When a
plate, is required it is taken from the top of the stack. The first plate placed on the stack is the last
one to be used. 

- LIFO Structure: Stacks follow the "Last In, First Out" principle—where you add and remove from the top.

- Core Operations: The main actions are push (add an item to the top) and pop (remove the top item)

- Implementation
There are two ways of implementing stack ADT; 
• Simple array based implementation
• Linked lists implementation

Array: Fast and simple but has a fixed size. If you push too much, you’re stuck unless you resize it.
Linked List: Grows dynamically—perfect if you don’t know how big your stack will get, though it uses a bit more memory for pointers.
